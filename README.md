a [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) app for playing with words

## what're we gonna do even?

i think a fun start would be to provide an API for quickly looking up words that match a simple, single-star glob pattern

e.g., 

- the query `*atie` should return all words ending in `atie`

- the query `voor*` should return all words beginning with `voor`

- the query `n*w` should return all words beginning with `n`, and ending with `w`

things to consider:

1. we don't want to load the entire file into memory
1. we could always process the txt file into a nicer data structure

### other ideas for the future

incorporate frequency and POS data as query parameters, e.g., support queries like

- all words ending in `sje` that appear in top 20K words
- all adverbs not ending in `lijk`

also fuzzy search could be cool

also also to spice things up, we could support regex syntax, or get fancy and try to do something akin to [lucene queries](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html)

then, another off-the-cuff idea: it would be cool to write a cross-language cognate finder

## todo

- [ ] do research on other good, free corpora. ([here is an article that links to 14 dutch text datasets](https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/14-best-dutch-language-datasets-for-machine-learning/))

## boring todos

- [ ] use a .env file 
- [ ] add a python linter
- [ ] UI-ify some stuff

## setup

### the "database"

our database will just be a text file for now. yay! easy!

i opted for the TSV, POS-tagged word frequency dataset from crr.ugent.be. [the link is here](http://crr.ugent.be/subtlex-nl/SUBTLEX-NL.cd-above2.with-pos.txt.zip)

dowload and unzip the text file into the root of this repo. the contents will be ignored in our repo _because we use version control responsibily <3_.

this file, which should be named `SUBTLEX-NL.cd-above2.with-pos.txt`, will be our database for now.

### the web server

> inspiration taken from the [instructions on the flask website for installing dependencies](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation)

install python 3.8, preferably using a tool like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (see below)

once that's done, activate your virtual environment and install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

thennnnn run the app

```sh
# not windows friendly btw
FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=hoi.py flask run
```

> **NOTE** the windows commands for starting the flask server are [on the flask website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)

and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/words for funsies

the server should reload on code changes now (because of the `FLASK_ENV=development` line above)

### using `pyenv`

use the `pyenv local` command to set the local version in this repository to something like 3.8.1 (_note: the `.python-version` file generated by this command is ignored by our .gitignore_)


create and activate the virtual env (if you're using pyenv, you can also make use of [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv))

```sh
pyenv virtualenv venv
pyenv activate venv
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

after this you can `pip install Flask`
